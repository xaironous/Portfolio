# IoT & Embedded Systems  

| Project Link | Tools | Project Description |  
|---|---|---|  
| üå± [Stevia Plant Monitoring & Automation](https://github.com/xaironous/Plant_Monitoring) | Arduino IDE, ESP32, MQTT | This repository contains my project on IoT-based monitoring and irrigation automation for Stevia plants. The system uses ESP32, multiple soil moisture sensors, and a pH sensor, with data transmitted via MQTT. The irrigation process is automated based on soil moisture thresholds and can also be controlled remotely through an MQTT command. |  
| üåæ [Wireless Sensor Network for Plantation](https://github.com/xaironous/WSN) | Arduino IDE, ESP32, ESP-NOW | This repository contains my project on a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for real-time environmental monitoring. The system uses ESP32 and ESP-NOW for low-power, long-range data transmission, collecting temperature, humidity, and soil moisture data. The design focuses on energy efficiency, utilizing deep sleep mode to extend battery life while ensuring reliable data communication. |
| üîê [Automatic Gate System](https://github.com/xaironous/Automatic_Gate) | Arduino IDE, Arduino UNO, RFID | This repository contains my project on an automatic gate system using Arduino and RFID technology. The system enables secure access control by scanning RFID cards, verifying user authorization, and triggering a servo motor to open or close the gate. |
| üö¶ [Traffic Light Simulation](https://github.com/xaironous/Traffic_Light_Simulation) | FPGA, Xilinx Spartan 3E, VHDL | This repository contains my project on traffic light simulation using FPGA, implemented with VHDL on a Xilinx Spartan 3E board. The system simulates a traffic control mechanism with multiple states, managing signal transitions for both road traffic and pedestrian crossings. |
| ‚è∞ [Alarm Clock](https://github.com/xaironous/Alarm_Clock) | Arduino IDE, Arduino UNO, RTC Module | This repository contains my first microcontroller project, where I built a digital alarm clock using Arduino. The system features timekeeping with an RTC module, an LCD 16x2 display, and an alarm function that activates a buzzer at a set time. |
